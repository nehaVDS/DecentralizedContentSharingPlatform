# Decentralized Content Sharing Platform

## Project Description
The Decentralized Content Sharing Platform is a blockchain-based solution that allows creators to publish and monetize their work directly. By utilizing the Stellar blockchain and smart contracts, the platform ensures transparent and fair compensation for creators, while simplifying the process of licensing and managing intellectual property rights.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to empower content creators by providing a decentralized platform where they can share their work without intermediaries, retain control over their creations, and receive fair compensation. The platform leverages the security, transparency, and efficiency of blockchain technology to ensure that creators are paid directly and fairly for their work.

## Key Features
- **Content Publishing:** Creators can easily upload and share their work on the platform, making it accessible to a global audience.
- **Monetization Options:** Content creators can set their own prices, sell licenses, or offer subscription-based access to their content, with payments handled by smart contracts.
- **Smart Contract Licensing:** Automatically enforce licensing agreements through smart contracts, ensuring creators are compensated based on the terms they set.
- **Decentralized Payments:** All transactions are processed in Lumens (XLM) on the Stellar blockchain, providing fast and low-cost payments directly to the creators.
- **Ownership and Royalty Tracking:** Smart contracts track ownership and ensure proper distribution of royalties for content that is licensed or resold.
- **Transparent and Secure:** Blockchain technology guarantees the transparency of transactions and ensures that all parties adhere to the agreed-upon terms.
